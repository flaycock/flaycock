Hello, I'm flaycock and I'm a Javascript developer.
This repo is a collection of mini personal projects I have worked on. Most of these projects aren't complete; they are just itches I wanted to scratch.
I work using Node and React, and all the work seen here was done on my raspberry Pi.
Feel free to take a look around :)
